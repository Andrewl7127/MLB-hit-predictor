## Methodology **[NEXT PAGE ->](./weatherandwind.html "next")**

To importance of data of each baseball stadium stems from internal player factors of their envoirnments. Players will tend to have a notion to feel more comfortable at there home stadium and less comfertable at away stadiums (or sometimes the other way around). This directly affects a players perofmance and causes the stadium to play an incremental role in the dataset.
